### Session #5

Five players for D&D tonight.

  * [Alex](/characters/dar.qmd), [Ashley](/characters/ahndahn.qmd), [Eric](/characters/sabin.qmd), [Keith](/characters/foster.qmd) and [Quinn](/characters/andy.qmd)

### Recap

Everyone got their characters painted.

I painted Geran for Pete so blame me not him for that paint job.

Alex got his new character mostly sorted out.  He'll be playing a Hunter.  We'll finish up the character sheet next week.
