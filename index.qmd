### Welcome!

This is the internet home of an in person weekly D&D campaign.

I don't know exactly where this is leading. The idea is simply to create a deeply hyperlinked chronicle of our campaign.

My goal is to represent the game as it is, covering both the fiction and the mechanics. Hopefully the result is something unique and interesting.

This experiment was largely inspired by the [Aaron Alston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Allston)'s [Strike Force](https://preview.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/196663/Aaron-Allstons-Strike-Force) [Archives](https://highrockpress.us/products/strike-force-archives-pdf) which was the result of a [22 year](https://youtu.be/Emths7qOlTs) long [Champions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champions_(role-playing_game)) campaign and a few other famous [long running D&D games](https://youtu.be/nJ-ehbVQYxI).

If you're new the best place to start is with the most recent [session recap](/sessions/index.qmd).

We started this campaign 04/06/24 so it's still the early days.
