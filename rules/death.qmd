The rules for Dying and Death’s Door on page 185 are used as written.

The effect of Death is changed as follows.

If you fail a save while at Death’s Door you become ineligible for experience from that nights session as if you died and continue loose 1 hit point each round until stabilized.

If there’s no prospect of anyone rendering aid in a timely manner your character dies.

The rules of Stabilization and Recovery on page 186 still apply as written.

### Explanation

The goal is to have death be uncommon in this campaign but it still needs to have a consequence to prevent reckless behavior.
