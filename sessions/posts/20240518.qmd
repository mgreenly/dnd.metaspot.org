### Session #7

Six players plus one guest for D&D tonight.

  * [Ashley](/characters/ahndahn.qmd), [Eric](/characters/sabin.qmd), [Keith](/characters/foster.qmd), [Michael](/characters/asmodean.qmd), [Spencer](/characters/garen.qmd) and [Quinn](/characters/andy.qmd)

### Recap

Each of the characters started to explore the city of Port Haven.

Andy and Foster took labor jobs on the docks and at the brewery respectively.  

Sabin sold the expensive textiles they looted from their wrecked ship to an upscale haberdashery.  While there he was warned by the proprietor to keep the fact he's an outsider a secret. 

Geran swindled a couple of local jewelers by swapping fake colored glass gems for real ones while pretending to shop for an apology gift for his upset wife.  He made off with a significant haul.

Separately both Asmodean and Ahndahn tried to send courier messages home only to learn the no one's ever heard of the places they come from.

Ahndahn visited the temple district and discovered an ancient sect of her religion thought to be extinct.  The priests had no knowledge of the temples and cities that Ahndahn knew.  A bit frustrated Ahndahn went to the library to see what maps existed and discovered that Port Haven lies at the center of a large archipelago known as the Serpent Isles and that a dozen other large archipelagos exist but are separated by huge distances and are only partially mapped.  She also discovered that no maps exist for any places familiar to her.
