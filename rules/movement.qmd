  * **Move Action:** You can move your speed as a move action. You can take that move action before or after your standard action.
  * **Double Move:** If you forgo your standard action you can take two move actions on your turn which lets you move double your speed.
  * **Run:** You can run as a full round action. You must move in a straight line and cannot enter any square that costs more than 5â€™ to move through. If your speed is reduced by armor you move triple your speed. If your speed is not reduced by armor you move quadruple your speed.

### Exceptions

Some feats and class abilities allow you to use a Full Round Action to move before and after an attack.

  * **Feat: Shot on the Run** - Mastery 4(p.142)
