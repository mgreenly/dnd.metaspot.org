# Voyage to Port Haven

We had a bit of a shift in the game tonight.  The group got passage on a merchant ship to the city of Port Haven.

During the voyage they were attacked by some untrustworthy crewman after flashing their coin purses around a bit to much but they arrived at Port Haven safely and got lodging. 

It's still the early days and we're not in the thick of the story just yet but I'm looking forward to what's coming next.

I had fun introducing the new locale and what I hope will be a few reoccurring characters.
